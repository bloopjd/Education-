           <h2>Solar System - NASA</h2>
              <p>NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, is a pioneer in the exploration of our solar system and beyond, leading numerous missions that have provided invaluable insights into the celestial bodies in space.</p>
              <p>Mars, often referred to as the "Red Planet," has been a focal point of NASA's research, with rovers like Curiosity and Perseverance investigating its surface.</p>
              <p>Cassini-Huygens, a NASA mission to Saturn, unveiled stunning images of the ringed planet and its moons, including Titan.</p>
              <p>NASA's Juno spacecraft has closely studied Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, unveiling its enigmatic secrets.</p>
              <p>Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, launched by NASA, continue their journey beyond the solar system, providing insights into interstellar space.</p>
              <p>The forthcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is expected to redefine our understanding of the cosmos.</p>
              <p>New Horizons, another NASA spacecraft, offered the first up-close images of Pluto, transforming our perception of this distant dwarf planet.</p>
              <p>The Artemis program seeks to return humans to the Moon and create a sustainable presence, serving as a stepping stone for future Mars missions.</p>
              <p>NASA's exploration of the solar system is a source of inspiration for the next generation of scientists and deepens our curiosity <a onclick="openG();" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit; cursor: text;">about</a> the universe.</p>

        <section id="acids-alkalis">
          <h2>Acids and Alkalis with H+ Protons</h2>
              <p>Acids and alkalis are fundamental concepts in chemistry, where H+ protons play a vital role in determining their properties.</p>
              <p>An acid is a substance that releases H+ ions in water, increasing the concentration of H+ ions and lowering the pH.</p>
              <p>Common acids include hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4), both strong acids that readily donate H+ ions.</p>
              <p>Alkalis, on the other hand, are substances that release OH- ions (hydroxide ions) in water and have a pH greater than 7.</p>
              <p>Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and potassium hydroxide (KOH) are examples of strong alkalis that dissociate into OH- ions.</p>
              <p>The pH scale measures the concentration of H+ ions in a solution, with values below 7 indicating acidity and values above 7 indicating alkalinity.</p>
              <p>Acids and alkalis can neutralize each other, with H+ ions from the acid reacting with OH- ions from the alkali to form water.</p>
              <p>Buffer solutions are essential in maintaining stable pH levels in various chemical and biological processes, helping resist drastic changes in acidity.</p>
              <p>Understanding the behavior of H+ protons in chemical reactions is crucial in fields like medicine, environmental science, and industry.</p>
              <p>The study of acids, alkalis, and H+ protons is foundational in chemistry and provides insights into a wide range of chemical <a onclick="openS();" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit; cursor: text;">reactions</a> and phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Planetary Exploration - Beyond NASA</h2>
            <p>Planetary Exploration - Beyond NASA delves into the exciting world of space exploration conducted by various international space agencies and organizations.</p>
            <p>While NASA is known for its missions to the solar system, other space agencies like the European Space Agency (ESA) have also made significant contributions.</p>
            <p>ESA's ExoMars program, for example, is dedicated to searching for signs of past or present life on Mars, complementing NASA's efforts.</p>
          <p>Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, boasts a rich history of planetary exploration, including missions to Venus, <a onclick="openR();" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit; cursor: text;">Mars</a>, and the Moon.</p>


            <p>Collaborations between different space agencies, such as the Mars Science Laboratory, demonstrate how global cooperation advances our understanding of other worlds.</p>
            <p>Discover how international partnerships create a united front in the quest to unlock the mysteries of the cosmos.</p>
            <p>From the mysterious methane on Mars to the icy moons of Jupiter, planetary exploration goes beyond national borders.</p>
            <p>Space exploration fuels curiosity and drives scientific discovery, and it's a truly global endeavor.</p>
            <p>Beyond NASA, there are ambitious plans to explore asteroids, return samples from other celestial bodies, and eventually send humans to Mars.</p>
            <p>Planetary exploration inspires the next generation of explorers and fosters cooperation on a global scale.</p>
